MYPhysio system provide physiotherapy professionals by provide rehabilitation plan through the web-based system
and native android application.  
It helps keep patient out of hospitals, emergency rooms and nursing homes especially elderly and patients 
with serious musculoskeletal injury.

becomes more expensive.
